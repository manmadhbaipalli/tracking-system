I'll help you create a detailed technical design for this FastAPI application. Let me start by reading the analysis from the previous phase.
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/nnnnnnnnnnnn-analysis/analysis.md"}
The analysis file doesn't exist yet. Let me check if there's a main branch or any existing project structure:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find . -type f -name \"*.md\" 2>/dev/null | head -20", "description": "Find all markdown files in the project"}
Let me check for artifacts related to the task ID:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la artifacts/ 2>/dev/null", "description": "List all artifact directories"}
Now let me check the analysis for the nnnnnnnnnnnn task:
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/nnnnnnnnnnnn-analysis"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la artifacts/nnnnnnnnnnnn-analysis/ 2>/dev/null", "description": "List files in the analysis directory"}
