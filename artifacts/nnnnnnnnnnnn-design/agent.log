I'll start by reading the analysis from the previous phase to understand the codebase context and requirements.
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/nnnnnnnnnnnn-analysis/analysis.md"}
Let me check what artifacts exist:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find /artifacts -type f -name \"*.md\" 2>/dev/null | head -20", "description": "List all markdown files in artifacts directory"}
Let me check if the artifacts directory exists:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la /artifacts 2>/dev/null || echo \"No /artifacts directory\"", "description": "Check artifacts directory structure"}
The artifacts directory doesn't exist yet. Let me check the current working directory and project structure:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "pwd && ls -la", "description": "Check current directory"}
Great! Now let me check the artifacts directory:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la /c/Manmadh/genai/claude-code-agents/workspace/nnnnnnnnnnnn-agent-5/artifacts/", "description": "Check artifacts directory contents"}
