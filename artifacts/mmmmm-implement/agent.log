I'll help you implement the FastAPI application based on the design. Let me start by reading the design document and understanding the requirements.
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/mmmmm-design/design.md"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find /artifacts -type f -name \"*.md\" | head -20", "description": "Find all design and analysis artifacts"}
Let me check what files and directories exist:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la /artifacts 2>/dev/null || echo \"No artifacts directory\"", "description": "Check if artifacts directory exists"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la / | grep -E \"(artifacts|src|app)\" || echo \"Checking root structure\"", "description": "Check root directory structure"}
Let me check the current working directory:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "pwd && ls -la", "description": "Check current directory and list files"}
Great! Now let me read the design document:
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/c/Manmadh/genai/claude-code-agents/workspace/mmmmm-agent-4/artifacts/mmmmm-design/design.md"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la /c/Manmadh/genai/claude-code-agents/workspace/mmmmm-agent-4/artifacts/", "description": "Check artifacts directory"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find . -name \"*.md\" -type f", "description": "Find all markdown files"}
