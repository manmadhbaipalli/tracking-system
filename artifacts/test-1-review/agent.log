I'll help you complete this review task. Let me start by understanding the current state of the project and reading all prior artifacts.
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find . -type f -name \"*.md\" | grep -E \"(artifacts|README)\" | head -20", "description": "Find all markdown and artifact files"}
[tool_use] Glob: {"pattern": "artifacts/**/*.md"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la artifacts/ 2>/dev/null || echo \"artifacts directory check\"", "description": "Check artifacts directory structure"}
Now let me read all the prior artifacts to understand the full context:
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/test-1-analysis/analysis.md"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/test-1-design/design.md"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/test-1-implement/implement.md"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/test-1-test/test.md"}
Let me check what files exist in these directories:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find artifacts/test-1-* -type f -name \"*.md\" 2>/dev/null", "description": "List all markdown files in test-1 artifacts"}
