I'll help you complete the design phase for the test-1 task. Let me start by reading the analysis from the previous phase and understanding the current codebase.
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/test-1-analysis/analysis.md"}
[tool_use] Glob: {"pattern": "**/*.py"}
[tool_use] Glob: {"pattern": "**/*.md"}
Let me check the structure of the artifacts directory:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find /artifacts -type f -name \"*.md\" 2>/dev/null | head -20", "description": "Find all markdown files in artifacts directory"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la /artifacts 2>/dev/null || ls -la artifacts 2>/dev/null || pwd && ls -la", "description": "Check current directory and artifacts structure"}
Good! Now let me check the analysis file that should exist:
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/test-1-analysis/analysis.md"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la artifacts/test-1-analysis/", "description": "Check contents of test-1-analysis directory"}
