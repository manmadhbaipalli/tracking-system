I'll help you complete the analysis phase of this FastAPI application task. Let me start by exploring the codebase to understand the current state and requirements.
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find . -type f -name \"*.py\" | head -20", "description": "Find Python files to understand the codebase structure"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la", "description": "List root directory to see project structure"}
