I'll start by reading the design document to understand what needs to be implemented.
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/fast-auth-system-final-design/design.md"}
Let me explore the artifacts directory structure:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find /artifacts -type f -name \"*.md\" 2>/dev/null | head -20", "description": "Find markdown files in artifacts directory"}
Let me check the current working directory and project structure:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "pwd && ls -la", "description": "Check current directory and list contents"}

[RESULT] Completed in 4 turns, cost=$0.0083
