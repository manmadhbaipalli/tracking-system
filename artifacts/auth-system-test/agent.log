I'll start by reading the implementation notes and understanding what was built in the previous phase.
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/auth-system-implement/implementation.md"}
Let me check what artifacts exist in the directory:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find /artifacts -type f -name \"*.md\" 2>/dev/null | head -20"}
Let me check the project structure to understand the codebase:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find . -type f -name \"*.py\" | head -20"}
Good! The project already exists. Let me explore the main application structure to understand what was implemented:
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/app/main.py"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/app"}
Let me check the current working directory and structure:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "pwd && ls -la"}
