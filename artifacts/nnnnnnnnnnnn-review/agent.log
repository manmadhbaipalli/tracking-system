I'll start by reviewing the artifacts and understanding the task structure, then analyze all code changes comprehensively.
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find artifacts -type f -name \"*.md\" | sort", "description": "Find all artifact files to understand the project history"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la", "description": "Check the repository structure"}
Now let me read the analysis and design documents:
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/fastapi-app-analysis/analysis.md"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/fastapi-app-design/design.md"}
Let me check what artifacts exist:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find artifacts -type f | head -20", "description": "List all files in artifacts directory"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find artifacts -type f -name \"*.md\" 2>/dev/null", "description": "Find markdown files in artifacts"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "cat artifacts/fastapi-app-analysis/analysis.md", "description": "Read analysis artifact"}
