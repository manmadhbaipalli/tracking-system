I'll complete this review task by analyzing all code changes, running tests, and writing a comprehensive review. Let me start by exploring the artifacts and understanding the full history.
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find artifacts -type f -name \"*.md\" | head -20", "description": "Find all markdown files in artifacts directory"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la artifacts/ 2>/dev/null || echo \"No artifacts directory found\"", "description": "List artifacts directory"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find . -type f -name \"*.py\" | grep -E \"(app|main|test)\" | head -20", "description": "Find Python files related to app and tests"}
Now let me read the artifact files to understand the full history:
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/fast-auth-system-final-analysis/analysis.md"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/fast-auth-system-final-design/design.md"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/fast-auth-system-final-implement/implementation.md"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/fast-auth-system-final-test/test_results.md"}
Let me check what artifacts actually exist:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls artifacts/fast-auth-system-final-*", "description": "List fast-auth-system-final artifacts"}
