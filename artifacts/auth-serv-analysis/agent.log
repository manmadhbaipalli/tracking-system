I'll start by analyzing the requirements and exploring the codebase to provide a comprehensive analysis. Let me begin by understanding the project structure and existing patterns.
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find /home -type f -name \"*.md\" | head -20", "description": "Search for documentation files to understand project structure"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la", "description": "List current directory contents"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find . -type f \\( -name \"*.py\" -o -name \"*.json\" -o -name \"*.toml\" -o -name \"*.yaml\" -o -name \"*.yml\" \\) | head -30", "description": "Find Python and config files to understand project structure"}
Good! The project already has a structure. Let me explore the key files to understand the current implementation and requirements.
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/app/main.py"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/app/config.py"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/app/logging_config.py"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/app/exceptions.py"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/requirements.txt"}
Let me check the absolute paths:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "pwd", "description": "Get current working directory"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find . -type f -name \"*.py\" -o -name \"*.txt\" | sort", "description": "List all Python and requirements files"}

[RESULT] Completed in 4 turns, cost=$0.0151
