I'll start by exploring the codebase to understand the current structure and then analyze the requirements for the auth-serv application.
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find . -type f -name \"*.py\" | head -20", "description": "Find Python files to understand project structure"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la", "description": "List root directory contents"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find . -type f \\( -name \"*.md\" -o -name \"*.txt\" -o -name \"*.yml\" -o -name \"*.yaml\" -o -name \"*.json\" \\) | grep -E \"(README|requirements|setup|config|docker)\" | head -20", "description": "Find configuration and documentation files"}
Good! I can see there's already a FastAPI project structure in place. Let me explore the existing code more thoroughly:
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/app/main.py"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/requirements.txt"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/app/config.py"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/app/logging_config.py"}
Let me check the actual file structure with a different approach:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "pwd", "description": "Print working directory"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la app/", "description": "List app directory"}
