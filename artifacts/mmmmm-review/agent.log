I'll help you complete this review phase. Let me start by understanding the current state of the project by reading the artifacts and examining the code.
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find . -type f -name \"*.md\" | head -20", "description": "Find markdown files to locate artifacts"}
[tool_use] Glob: {"pattern": "artifacts/**/*.md"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la artifacts/ 2>/dev/null || echo \"No artifacts directory found\"", "description": "Check for artifacts directory"}
Now let me read the key artifacts to understand the project:
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/mmmmm-analysis/analysis.md"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/mmmmm-design/design.md"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/mmmmm-implement/implement.md"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/mmmmm-test/test_results.md"}
Let me check what files exist in these artifact directories:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la artifacts/mmmmm-*/", "description": "List files in mmmmm artifact directories"}
Let me read the prompts to understand what was done:
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/mmmmm-analysis/prompt.txt"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/mmmmm-design/prompt.txt"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/mmmmm-implement/prompt.txt"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/mmmmm-test/prompt.txt"}
Let me explore the project structure itself:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find . -name \"*.py\" -o -name \"*.md\" -o -name \"requirements*.txt\" | grep -v __pycache__ | grep -v artifacts | sort", "description": "Find project files excluding artifacts"}
