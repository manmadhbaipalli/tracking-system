I'll start by reading the analysis from the previous phase to understand the codebase and requirements, then create a detailed technical design.
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/auth-serv-analysis/analysis.md"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find /artifacts -type f -name \"*.md\" | head -20", "description": "List all artifact files to understand available context"}
Let me check the artifacts directory structure:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la /artifacts/ 2>/dev/null || echo \"Checking current directory\"; pwd; ls -la", "description": "List artifacts directory and current directory"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la /c/Manmadh/genai/claude-code-agents/workspace/auth-serv-agent-3/artifacts/", "description": "List artifacts directory contents"}

[RESULT] Completed in 4 turns, cost=$0.0102
