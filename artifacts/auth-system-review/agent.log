[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find /tmp -type f -name \"*.md\" 2>/dev/null | head -20", "description": "Find artifact files to understand project structure"}
Let me check the current working directory and project structure:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "pwd && ls -la", "description": "Check current directory and list files"}
Good! Now let me read all the artifacts to understand the project history:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find artifacts -type f -name \"*.md\" | sort", "description": "List all artifact markdown files"}
Now let me read all the artifacts to understand the full context:
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/c/Manmadh/genai/claude-code-agents/workspace/artifacts/fastapi-app-analysis/analysis.md"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/c/Manmadh/genai/claude-code-agents/workspace/artifacts/fastapi-app-design/design.md"}
Now let me explore the current codebase to understand what's been implemented:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find app tests -type f -name \"*.py\" | sort", "description": "List all Python files in app and tests directories"}
