I'll start by reading the analysis from the previous phase to understand the codebase and requirements.
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/auth-system-analysis/analysis.md"}
Let me check what files exist in the artifacts directory:
[tool_use] Glob: {"pattern": "artifacts/**"}
I can see there's an `auth-system-analysis` folder. Let me check what's in it:
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/auth-system-analysis/agent.log"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/auth-system-analysis/prompt.txt"}
It seems the analysis files might not exist yet. Let me check the project structure to understand what we're working with:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find . -type f -name \"*.py\" -o -name \"*.md\" | head -30", "description": "Find Python and markdown files in project"}
Good! Now let me explore the existing codebase to understand the structure:
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/app/main.py"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/app/models.py"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/app/schemas.py"}
