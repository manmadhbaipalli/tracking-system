I'll start by reviewing all the artifacts and understanding what has been implemented so far.
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find artifacts -type f -name \"*.md\" | head -20", "description": "Find all markdown artifacts to understand the project history"}
Let me read these artifacts to understand the full context:
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/fastapi-app-analysis/analysis.md"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/fastapi-app-design/design.md"}
Let me check what artifacts exist:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la artifacts/ 2>/dev/null || echo \"No artifacts directory found\"", "description": "Check artifacts directory structure"}
