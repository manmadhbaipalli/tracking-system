I'll help you design the fast-auth-system-final application. Let me start by reading the analysis from the previous phase.
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/fast-auth-system-final-analysis/analysis.md"}
Let me check what files exist in the artifacts directory:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find /artifacts -type f -name \"*.md\" 2>/dev/null | head -20", "description": "List markdown files in artifacts directory"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la /artifacts 2>/dev/null || echo \"No artifacts directory found\"", "description": "Check artifacts directory"}

[RESULT] Completed in 4 turns, cost=$0.0085
