I'll start by understanding the current state of the project and what was implemented in the previous phase.
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/auth-serv-implement/implementation.md"}
[tool_use] Glob: {"pattern": "artifacts/**/*.md"}
Let me check what files exist in the artifacts directory:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find /artifacts -type f -name \"*.md\" 2>/dev/null | head -20"}
Let me check if there's an artifacts directory and what's in the current working directory:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "pwd && ls -la"}

[RESULT] Completed in 4 turns, cost=$0.0085
