I'll start by reading the design document from the previous phase to understand what needs to be implemented.
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/test-2-design/design.md"}
Let me explore the artifacts directory to find the design document:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find /artifacts -type f -name \"*.md\" | head -20", "description": "Find all markdown files in artifacts directory"}

[RESULT] Completed in 3 turns, cost=$0.0055
