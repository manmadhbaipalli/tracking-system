I'll help you implement the auth-serv feature based on the design. Let me start by examining the design document and understanding the requirements.
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/auth-serv-design/design.md"}
[tool_use] Glob: {"pattern": "artifacts/**"}
Let me explore the directory structure first:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find . -type f -name \"*.md\" | head -20", "description": "Search for markdown files including design documents"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la artifacts/ 2>/dev/null || echo \"artifacts directory not found\"", "description": "Check artifacts directory structure"}
Good! Now let me read the auth-serv design document:
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/auth-serv-design/design.md"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la artifacts/auth-serv-implement/", "description": "Check what's in the implement directory"}
