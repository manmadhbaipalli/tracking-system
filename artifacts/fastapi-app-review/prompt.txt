## Task: fastapi-app-review
**[REVIEW] Build FastAPI application with auth, logging, error handling, and circuit breaker**

**Pipeline:** `fastapi-app` | **Phase:** `review`

## Description
Build a production-ready FastAPI application with the following requirements:

### Functional Requirements
1. **Authentication Endpoints**
   - POST /auth/register: User registration with email, password (hashed with bcrypt)
   - POST /auth/login: User login returning JWT access + refresh tokens
   - POST /auth/refresh: Refresh expired access tokens
   - POST /auth/logout: Invalidate tokens

2. **Centralized Logging System**
   - Structured JSON logging (timestamp, level, request_id, endpoint, user_id)
   - Request/response logging middleware
   - Correlation ID propagation across all logs
   - Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR

3. **Centralized Exception Handling**
   - Global exception handler middleware
   - Custom exception classes (AuthError, ValidationError, NotFoundError, ServiceUnavailableError)
   - Consistent error response format with error code, message, details
   - Stack traces logged but never exposed to clients

4. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
   - Implement circuit breaker for external service calls
   - States: CLOSED (normal) then OPEN (failing) then HALF_OPEN (testing recovery)
   - Configurable failure threshold, timeout, and recovery window
   - Fallback responses when circuit is open

5. **Swagger/OpenAPI**
   - Auto-generated Swagger UI at /docs
   - ReDoc at /redoc
   - Proper request/response schemas for all endpoints
   - Authentication scheme documented in OpenAPI spec

### Technical Stack
- Python 3.12, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic v2
- SQLite for development, PostgreSQL-ready
- JWT via python-jose, passwords via passlib[bcrypt]
- pytest for testing

## Phase: review
Review all code changes for quality, security, and correctness. Read all prior artifacts. Write review findings to artifacts/{task_id}/review.md.

**Note:** This task depended on: fastapi-app-test. Those are now merged into main.

## File Constraints
You may ONLY modify these files (other files are locked by other agents working in parallel):
  - app/__init__.py
  - app/main.py
  - app/config.py
  - app/models.py
  - app/schemas.py
  - app/auth/__init__.py
  - app/auth/router.py
  - app/auth/service.py
  - app/auth/jwt.py
  - app/middleware/__init__.py
  - app/middleware/logging.py
  - app/middleware/error_handler.py
  - app/middleware/correlation.py
  - app/circuit_breaker.py
  - app/exceptions.py
  - app/logging_config.py
  - tests/__init__.py
  - tests/conftest.py
  - tests/test_auth.py
  - tests/test_circuit_breaker.py
  - tests/test_middleware.py
  - requirements.txt
  - README.md

If you need to create new files, place them under the directories implied by the locked file paths.
Do NOT modify files outside your assigned scope — doing so will cause merge conflicts.

## Your Role: REVIEW AGENT
You are the final agent in an SDLC pipeline. All previous phases are complete.

## Prior Artifacts
Read ALL artifacts under `artifacts/` to understand the full history:
- Analysis, design, implementation notes, and test results

## Workflow
1. Review all code changes for:
   - Correctness — does it match the design?
   - Security — OWASP top 10, input validation, auth checks
   - Performance — N+1 queries, unnecessary allocations, missing indexes
   - Maintainability — naming, structure, documentation
2. Run the full test suite.
3. Write your review to `artifacts/fastapi-app-review/review.md`:
   - **Approved / Changes Needed**
   - Specific issues found with file:line references
   - Suggestions for improvement

If you find issues, fix them directly. This is the last gate before merge.

## Quality Requirements
- Write tests for any new functionality
- Do not break existing tests
- Follow the project's coding standards (see below)
- Keep changes minimal and focused on the task

## Project Standards
(No CLAUDE.md found — follow existing patterns in the codebase.)
