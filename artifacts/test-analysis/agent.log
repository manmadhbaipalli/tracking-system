I'll start by analyzing the requirements and exploring the codebase to understand the current state. Let me begin with the analysis phase.
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find . -type f -name \"*.md\" | grep -E \"(README|CLAUDE|requirements)\" | head -20", "description": "Look for existing documentation files"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la", "description": "Check current directory structure"}
[tool_use] Glob: {"pattern": "**/*.py"}
Good! The codebase already exists. Let me explore the existing files to understand the current implementation:
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/workspace/requirements.txt"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/workspace/app/main.py"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/workspace/app/models.py"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/workspace/app/schemas.py"}
