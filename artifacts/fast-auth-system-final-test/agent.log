I'll help you complete the testing phase for the fast-auth-system-final project. Let me start by exploring the project structure and reading the implementation notes.
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/fast-auth-system-final-implement/implementation.md"}
[tool_use] Glob: {"pattern": "artifacts/fast-auth-system-final*/**/*.md"}
Let me check the project structure first:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find . -type f -name \"*.md\" | head -20"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la"}

[RESULT] Completed in 4 turns, cost=$0.0085
