I'll start by reading the implementation notes and understanding what was implemented in the previous phase.
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/test-2-implement/implementation.md"}
Let me check what artifacts exist in the directory:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find /artifacts -type f -name \"*.md\" 2>/dev/null | head -20"}

[RESULT] Completed in 3 turns, cost=$0.0055
