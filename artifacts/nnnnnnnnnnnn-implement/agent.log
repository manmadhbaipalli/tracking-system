I'll start by reading the design document to understand what needs to be implemented.
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/nnnnnnnnnnnn-design/design.md"}
[tool_use] Glob: {"pattern": "/artifacts/**"}
Let me check the directory structure:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find /artifacts -type f 2>/dev/null | head -20", "description": "Find all files in artifacts directory"}
Let me check the current working directory and look for the design document:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "pwd && ls -la", "description": "Check current directory and list files"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find . -name \"design.md\" -o -name \"*.md\" | head -20", "description": "Find markdown files including design.md"}
Let me check the correct design file and the current project structure:
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/c/Manmadh/genai/claude-code-agents/workspace/nnnnnnnnnnnn-agent-4/artifacts/fastapi-app-design/design.md"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la app/ tests/ artifacts/", "description": "List project directories"}
