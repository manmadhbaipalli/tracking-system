I'll help you implement the FastAPI application with login, registration, centralized logging, exception handling, circuit breaker, and Swagger documentation. Let me start by reading the design document and exploring the project structure.
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/test-1-design/design.md"}
[tool_use] Glob: {"pattern": "**/*.md"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find . -type f -name \"*.py\" | head -20", "description": "Find Python files to understand project structure"}
Let me check the project structure first:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la", "description": "List current directory"}
Good! Now let me check the artifacts directory:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find artifacts -type f -name \"*.md\" | head -20", "description": "Find all markdown files in artifacts"}
