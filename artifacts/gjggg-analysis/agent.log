I'll start by exploring the codebase to understand the project structure and then analyze the requirements. Let me begin with a comprehensive exploration.
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find . -type f -name \"*.md\" | head -20", "description": "Find markdown documentation files"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la", "description": "List root directory contents"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find . -type f -name \"*.py\" | head -20", "description": "Find Python files in the project"}
Good! There's already a project structure. Let me examine the existing files to understand the architecture:
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/fastapi-app-analysis/analysis.md"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/fastapi-app-design/design.md"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/requirements.txt"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/app/main.py"}
Let me check what exists in the artifacts directory and examine the actual files:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la artifacts/", "description": "List artifacts directory"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "cat requirements.txt", "description": "Display requirements.txt"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "cat app/main.py", "description": "Display main.py"}
