I'll start by exploring the project structure and reading the implementation notes to understand what was built, then write comprehensive tests and document the results.
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find . -type f -name \"*.md\" | grep -E \"(artifacts|implementation)\" | head -20", "description": "Find implementation and artifact documentation files"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la artifacts/ 2>/dev/null || echo \"No artifacts directory yet\"", "description": "Check for existing artifacts directory"}
Let me read the implementation notes first:
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/test-1-implement/implementation.md"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/test-1-test/test-results.md"}
Let me check what's in the test-1-implement directory:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la artifacts/test-1-implement/", "description": "List contents of test-1-implement directory"}
