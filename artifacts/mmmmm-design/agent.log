I'll start by reading the analysis from the previous phase to understand the codebase and requirements.
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/mmmmm-analysis/analysis.md"}
Let me check what artifacts exist:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find /artifacts -type f -name \"*.md\" 2>/dev/null | head -20", "description": "Find existing artifact files"}
Let me check if the artifacts directory exists:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la /artifacts 2>/dev/null || echo \"artifacts directory does not exist\"", "description": "Check artifacts directory"}
Let me check the current working directory and explore the project structure:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "pwd && ls -la", "description": "Check current directory and list files"}
Good! The artifacts directory exists. Let me check what's in it:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find /c/Manmadh/genai/claude-code-agents/workspace/mmmmm-agent-1/artifacts -type f 2>/dev/null", "description": "List all files in artifacts directory"}
