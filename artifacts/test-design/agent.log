I'll help you complete the design phase for the FastAPI application. Let me start by exploring the project structure and understanding the previous analysis.
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find . -type f -name \"*.md\" | head -20", "description": "Find markdown files in the project"}
[tool_use] Glob: {"pattern": "artifacts/**/*.md"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la", "description": "List root directory contents"}
Let me check the previous analysis and existing design:
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/workspace/test-agent-1/artifacts/fastapi-app-analysis/analysis.md"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/workspace/test-agent-1/artifacts/fastapi-app-design/design.md"}
[tool_use] Glob: {"pattern": "app/**/*.py"}
