I'll start by reading the design document and analyzing the requirements, then implement the auth system accordingly.
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/auth-system-design/design.md"}
[tool_use] Glob: {"pattern": "artifacts/**/*.md"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts"}
Let me explore the project structure to understand the codebase:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find . -type f -name \"*.md\" | head -20", "description": "Find markdown files to understand project structure"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la | head -20", "description": "List files in current directory"}
Now let me read the design document:
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/fastapi-app-design/design.md"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/artifacts/fastapi-app-analysis/analysis.md"}
Let me check the directory structure properly:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la artifacts/", "description": "List artifact directories"}
Good! Let me read the auth-system design:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la artifacts/auth-system-design/", "description": "Check design directory contents"}

[RESULT] Completed in 6 turns, cost=$0.0180
