You are an autonomous coding agent. Your job is to complete the task below.

## Task: test-review
**[REVIEW] test**

**Pipeline:** `test` | **Phase:** `review`

## Description
1. Analyze the below requirement
	1. Create fastapi application with login, registration endpoints
	2. centralized logging system
	3. centralized exception handling
	4. implement circuit breaker
	5. swagger for all endpoints
2. Design the application
	1. Sequence Diagrams and flow diagrams in platuml
	2. design and create the db schema/tables
3. code implementation with proper testcases
4. execute testcases
5. review and optimize if any issues.

## Phase: review
Review all code changes for quality, security, and correctness. Read all prior artifacts. Write review findings to artifacts/{task_id}/review.md.

**Note:** This task depended on: test-test. Those are now merged into main.

## File Constraints
You may ONLY modify these files (other files are locked by other agents working in parallel):
  (no file restrictions — you may modify any file)

If you need to create new files, place them under the directories implied by the locked file paths.
Do NOT modify files outside your assigned scope — doing so will cause merge conflicts.

## Workflow
1. **Plan first.** Write your implementation plan to `artifacts/test-review/plan.md`.
2. **Implement.** Make the changes, following project conventions.
3. **Test.** Run relevant tests. If tests fail, fix the code before proceeding.
4. **Document.** Write decisions and trade-offs to `artifacts/test-review/findings.md`.
5. **Summarize.** Write a final summary to `artifacts/test-review/summary.md`.

## Quality Requirements
- Write tests for any new functionality
- Do not break existing tests
- Follow the project's coding standards (see below)
- Keep changes minimal and focused on the task

## Project Standards
(No CLAUDE.md found — follow existing patterns in the codebase.)
